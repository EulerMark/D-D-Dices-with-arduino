# D-D-Dices-with-arduino
Code and Cad for the D&D dice with arduino
The code was not made to be optimal but to work, there maybe something to change, feel free to change everything.
Also the CAD was made in Fusion 360 with the parts i have lying around, it may change if you buy different parts.
I didn't put the holes for the buttons and the cable for the 9v battery since i knew it may change, i drill the holes with a dremel and a fine drill bit.
